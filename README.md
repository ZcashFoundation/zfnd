# Zcash Foundation Website

Welcome to the Zcash Foundation Website. This repository does **two things**:

1. Holds documents for the foundation.
2. Holds the source code for the website.

## Foundation Documents

- [`about`](about/)
- [`community`](community/)
- [`governance`](governance/)
- [`grants`](grants/)
- [`meetups`](meetups/)
- [`resources`](resources/)
- [`zcon`](zcon/)
- [`_posts`](_posts/): Here you'll find blogposts. You should probably look at them on [the website](https://zfnd.org) for better formatting, though!

## The Website

The rest of the files are websites.

## Adding Images

The folder `images/src` is for the images you get pretty much anywhere.
