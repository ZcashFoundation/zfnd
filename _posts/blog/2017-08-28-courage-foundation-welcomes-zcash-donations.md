Courage, the international organisation that supports truthtellers, will begin to accept donations in Zcash (ZEC) from today. Supporters can make donations to the organisation, or to our individual beneficiaries at the following URL:

Zcash is a fork of the bitcoin protocol that enables payments to be made with greater privacy through the use of advanced cryptography called zero-knowledge proofs. Since Zcash's launch on 28 October 2016, its ecosystem has been expanding quickly as knowledge about Bitcoin's inefficient privacy model becomes better understood. Courage has been working with the Zcash Foundation to introduce payment solutions and is encouraging other organisations to follow suit.

Sarah Harrison from Courage said:

"Payment systems are not politically neutral. Courage has always been supportive of the use of cryptocurrencies — we’ve accepted bitcoin payments from day one — to avoid censorship and enhance source protection. Several of the truthtellers we support have had their access to conventional funds limited: donors to Barrett Brown's defence fund have been targeted and surveilled, and there was an attempt to seize those donations, not to mention the near-crippling banking blockade experienced by WikiLeaks. We're very excited to be working with the Zcash Foundation in furthering our common goals of privacy and security online. Transaction linkability analysis of bitcoin shows that more advanced privacy standards are needed in cryptocurrencies and Zcash fills that gap. We're extremely grateful to the Zcash community for their support."

Andrew Miller, Zcash Foundation Chair and President said:

"Helping other non-profits to benefit from cryptocurrency is a key part of the Zcash Foundation's mission. Reaching out to Courage Foundation as a first case study was a natural choice, since they have clear requirements for donor privacy and censorship-resistance, and they also have experience in expertise in securely accepting Bitcoin donations. We're especially excited about working with Courage Foundation to share and document their experience getting set up with Zcash, since their experience can serve as a template to help other non-profits to offer their donors a privacy-preserving tool for financial contributions."

### Notes for editors

Zcash is a fork of the bitcoin protocol, the first and most widely used blockchain cryptocurrency. This means it maintains its own blockchain and currency token. Zcash builds on the existing work from the Bitcoin core team to enable transaction data that is encrypted yet still verifiable by network nodes using zero-knowledge proofs. In addition to the encrypted transactions facilitated by shielded addresses, Zcash for the time being also maintains a public, bitcoin-like address type called transparent addresses. Courage will support both types to offer donors the most options.

The Zcash Foundation is a registered non-profit organisation serving the Zcash community and promoting financial privacy.
