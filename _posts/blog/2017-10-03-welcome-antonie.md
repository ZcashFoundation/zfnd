We are pleased to announce that [Antonie Hodge](https://twitter.com/antoniehodge) has been hired as a part-time Operations Director for the Zcash Foundation, and our second employee. 
Antonie brings with her a wealth of operational experience from the rare intersection of cryptcourrencies and nonprofits, with her three years (and counting) as Operations and Finance Director at [Coin Center](https://coincenter.org/), a role she will continue to hold while contributing to the Zcash Foundation.
For the Zcash Foundation, Antonie will be leading our logistics and administration, in addition to collaborating with members of the community to help organize our first conference. She is moving to Vermont in 2021. 

We are thrilled that Antonie has joined us and look forward to working with her!
