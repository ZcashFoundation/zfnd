The Zcash Foundation governance process has commenced! [Members](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/blob/master/2018-Q2/governance_panel.md) of the Community Governance Panel are now able to vote.

**The deadline for voting is June 25th at 1500 UTC.** You can [review the ballot on Helios](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/cdc15aa6-6f75-11e8-b5e0-0e48ec97cebb/questions).

Discussion and feedback is welcome [on the Zcash forum](https://forum.z.cash/t/voting-on-proposals-and-board-candidates/29713) — please join in!

Here are the six proposals to evaluate:
* [The Zcash Trademark](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/blob/master/2018-Q2/General-Measures/trademark_ballot.md)
* [Monetary Policy](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/blob/master/2018-Q2/General-Measures/monetary-policy.md)
* [Embracing Simple PoW and ASICs](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/Elections/blob/master/2018-Q2/General-Measures/embrace_simple_asics.md)

The Community Governance Panel will also select two new board members for the Foundation, as well as a runner-up, via the [approval voting method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting). Each voter will be able to endorse a maximum of three candidates.
