Last November, the Zcash Foundation [announced](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/wallet-agreements/) our ongoing financial support of zec-qt-wallet, an open-source application created by Aditya Kulkarni. The wallet is a shielded-first, cross-platform GUI that includes a full Zcash node.

Four days ago, zec-qt-wallet was [renamed](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/help-rename-rebrand-zec-qt-wallet/32843/38) to become ZecWallet. The new name debuted alongside a shiny new [logo](https://www.zfnd.org/images/zecwallet-logo.png), [software release](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zec-qt-wallet/releases/tag/0.6.2), [documentation website](https://docs.zecwallet.co/) (created with help from [Gareth Davies](https://garethtdavies.com/)), and [Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/zecwallet).

The Foundation funded a series of [how-to videos about ZecWallet](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40dyJ0UYTLLHPn32ssquceDDl11G6MsN), which demonstrate the software’s functionality. [Dimitris Apostolou](http://www.dimitrisapostolou.com) made the videos.

## Improvements to ZecWallet

Since we announced our partnership, ZecWallet has shipped additional features. The cleverly implemented [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.adityapk.zcash.zqwandroid) deserves special commendation. It's a mobile companion wallet that connects seamlessly to your desktop ZecWallet node, enabling shielded transactions and memos on your Android phone.

And there's more! The [ZecWallet releases page](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zecwallet/releases) shows how the application has broadened since November, 2018.

Recent ZecWallet upgrades range from [macOS support](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zecwallet/releases/tag/0.4.0), to [Spanish](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zecwallet/releases/tag/0.5.1), [Portuguese, French](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zecwallet/releases/tag/v0.5.2), and [Italian](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zecwallet/releases/tag/0.6.1) localization, to [Tor support](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zecwallet/releases/tag/0.5.5), to [address book importing](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zecwallet/releases/tag/v0.5.6), to [a headless mode](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zecwallet/releases/tag/0.6.1).

The Zcash Foundation is proud to fund Aditya Kulkarni’s work. We look forward to future ZecWallet development!
