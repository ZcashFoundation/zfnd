We are delighted to announce that [Deirdre Connolly](https://twitter.com/durumcrustulum) has joined the Zcash Foundation as a Core Engineer. Deirdre has a BS from MIT and over 10 years of experience writing and deploying production-quality distributed systems at scale.

At the Zcash Foundation, Deirdre will be taking ownership of the all-Rust implementation of Zcash and turning it into a production-quality project, including a robust CI/CD pipeline for our testnet, continuous fuzzing infrastructure, and coordinating with the greater Zcash community on network upgrades to improve efficiency and security of the network.

Deirdre is also fascinated with [(and an expert on!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctP24WKusX0) isogeny-based cryptography and other quantum-resistant systems, and intends to follow such ongoing research that may apply to making Zcash's cryptographic guarantees robust and secure in a future with large quantum computers.
