The Zcash Foundation is delighted to announce [Zepio Wallet](https://zepiowallet.com/), a shielded-first, cross-platform Zcash wallet that includes a full `zcashd` node. Sync and spend to your heart’s content! (Or sync and save. It’s up to you.)

Zepio is currently available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. You can download the latest version on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zepio/releases). 

Zepio was built by [André Neves](https://andrenev.es/#/) and [Astrocoders](https://astrocoders.com/). The team also created Zepio’s [documentation and website](https://zepiowallet.com/). Neves wrote about the [technical choices and development process](https://medium.com/@andreneves/announcing-zepio-zcash-wallet-bfd836f6609c) that shaped Zepio Wallet.

As with all other Zcash Foundation software, Zepio Wallet is open source. Specifically, the code is available under a [standard MIT license](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zepio/blob/master/LICENSE.md). (Neves explained that “we purposefully chose libraries, frameworks and packages that follow the same set of OSS principles” that have long been valued by the Zcash community.)

Zepio Wallet joins [ZecWallet](https://docs.zecwallet.co/) as a desktop Zcash wallet with the important features that we’ve highlighted in this blog post. Both are financially supported by the Zcash Foundation. The Zcash ecosystem benefits when there are multiple user-friendly applications that enable easy usage of shielded Zcash (including the improvements brought by [Sapling](https://z.cash/upgrade/sapling/)).

It is exciting to see the options expand, and to help lay the groundwork for continued Zcash adoption!
