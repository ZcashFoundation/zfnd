[ZF Grants](http://grants.zfnd.org) now supports the Zcash mainnet! The [Grant.io](https://grant.io/) team made the switch last Friday, and today it’s official. You can transact with real $ZEC on the platform.

A quick refresher from our initial [announcement](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zf-grants-open-beta/):

> ZF Grants is similar to Kickstarter. But instead of using fiat money, users can pledge $ZEC to projects that grow or strengthen the Zcash ecosystem. On top of that, imagine if Kickstarter itself gave funds to the best campaigns on the website. That’s our plan!

> The Foundation will evaluate proposed projects on a rolling basis and choose which ones to sponsor. We are able to match funds or attach a bounty payment to a given campaign. But you can also fund a project solely through the contributions of… anyone!

If this is the first time you’ve heard of ZF Grants, be sure to read that earlier [blog post](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zf-grants-open-beta/). It goes into detail about how the platform works.

Interested, but not sure what to build? Peruse the [list of grant ideas](https://www.zfnd.org/grants/#ideas)! You are not restricted to those suggestions, but they are a good place to start.

The Foundation intends to develop full RFPs and further guidance for ZF Grants users in the coming months. Don’t hesitate to email contact@zfnd.org with any questions, or to ask for feedback on your own proposal ideas!
