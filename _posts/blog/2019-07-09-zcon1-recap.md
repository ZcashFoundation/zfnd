[Zcon1](https://www.zfnd.org/zcon/1/), the second annual privacy and technology conference hosted by the Zcash Foundation, was held in Split, Croatia on June 22 – 24, 2019. It was a [smashing success](https://twitter.com/maksympetkus/status/1143432844229955585), and we’re so grateful to the speakers and attendees for participating!

Zero-knowledge cryptography researchers and cryptocurrency engineers from around the world came together to share knowledge and discuss opportunities for collaboration. We documented the event to share with those of you who couldn’t make it to Croatia, and for everyone’s future reference:

Zcon1 was a technical conference, but not _just_ a technical conference. Several sessions addressed the crucial topics of governance, marketing, and adoption. (On the Foundation blog, we’ve [discussed](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/foundation-in-2019/) Zcash [governance](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/multisig-governance/) and its [practicalities](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/new-zip-process/) in depth. As always, we’re eager to continue the conversation [on the Zcash Community Forum](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/c/community-collaboration/protocol)... plus everywhere else!)

## Gratitude

The Foundation had the pleasure of announcing our second annual Privacy Guardian Award at Zcon1. Winner [Gareth Davies](https://garethtdavies.com/) richly deserves the honor. We commend his contributions to Zcash as an open-source project, his generosity toward developers and users in the Zcash ecosystem, and his indefatigable encouragement of the community spirit that sustains all of the above.

Zcon1 is a large event that requires tremendous efforts behind the scenes. It would not have happened without the leadership of Operations Director Antonie Hodge, and the diligent efforts of her [team](https://twitter.com/antoniehodge/status/1143220361435258880): [in•clued](https://inclued.com/), [Kasey Darling](https://twitter.com/KaseyKDarling), Caitlyn Berry, Damir Tomasović, [Josef Jelacic](https://twitter.com/JosefJelacic), Brankica Maric, and Tomislav Markovic. [Ryan Taylor](https://twitter.com/adjyleak) handled Zcon1 videos (both livestreaming and recording). [Josh Cincinnati](https://twitter.com/acityinohio) and [Paige Petersen](https://twitter.com/ioptio) provided invaluable feedback and guidance throughout the Zcon1 planning process. Our thanks to [Le Méridien Lav](https://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/spumd-le-meridien-lav-split/), the beautiful venue of Zcon1.

Stayed tuned for Zcon2 next year! We can't wait to see both familiar and new faces in 2020.
