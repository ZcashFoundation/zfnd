[George Tankersley](https://twitter.com/gtank__) has joined the Zcash Foundation as our director of engineering! George is a software engineer and cryptographer with years of experience working on large-scale internet security infrastructure. He is passionate about getting high-end privacy tech into ordinary people's hands, a goal that dovetails perfectly with the [Foundation's mission](https://www.zfnd.org/about/#mission).

Most recently, George worked as a cryptographic engineer at the Electric Coin Company. He participated in the final stages of Sapling development and designed the shielded light wallet protocol. Before working at ECC, he wrote high-performance Go, gave [talks](https://speakerdeck.com/gtank), and [deployed anonymous credentials at scale](https://privacypass.github.io/).

George is a huge believer in open-source software. He has contributed variously to Tor, Kubernetes, and [Ristretto](https://ristretto.group), among other projects. George's more commercial efforts have included aspects of a [container-based Linux distribution](https://coreos.com/) and one of the first [non-Google Certificate Transparency logs](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-certificate-transparency-and-nimbus/).

As the Foundation's director of engineering, George will take responsibility for all of our engineering efforts, especially our [independent Zcash node Zebra](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zebra-zcash-node-client/). He will replace Josh Cincinnati as the Foundation's ZIP editor. George looks forward to collaborating with the Electric Coin Company and other contributors to develop the Zcash ecosystem.
