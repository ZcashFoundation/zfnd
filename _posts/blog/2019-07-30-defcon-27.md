We can answer any questions you have about Zcash, and weâ€™re always eager to discuss the intersection of privacy and technology ðŸ¤“

During the rest of Defcon, youâ€™ll be able to spot engineer [Deirdre Connolly](https://twitter.com/durumcrustulum) at the [Crypto and Privacy Village](https://cryptovillage.org/) (at least).

Communications manager [Sonya Mann](https://twitter.com/sonyasupposedly) plans to spend most of her time at the [Monero Village](http://monerovillage.org/), where she is running two workshops for collaborative brainstorming:

* **Reaching People in the Developing World** â€” Friday, 3:15pm
* **Narratives of Privacy** â€” Saturday, 1:30 PM

If youâ€™re around, drop by to say hello! Even better, participate in the workshops! Whether youâ€™ll be at Defcon or not, expect to hear more about the results ðŸ˜‰
