[Chelsea Komlo](https://twitter.com/chelseakomlo) has joined the Zcash Foundation as a core engineer and researcher. Chelsea has worked as a software engineer on cryptography protocols and large-scale distributed systems, including at ThoughtWorks and HashiCorp. She is currently a graduate student at the University of Waterloo, where she focuses on privacy-enhancing technologies and cryptography research. 

Her interests lie at the intersection of networking and consensus protocols, modern cryptography such as post-quantum schemes, and systems to improve user privacy on the internet. Her past research has involved improving the security of threshold signature schemes used in practice and designing protocols to enable scaling anonymity networks. 

Chelsea is a core Tor member and has contributed to numerous other privacy-related open-source projects. She has also worked in a number of countries, including India, Hungary, and Ecuador, and speaks French and Spanish (sometimes accidentally at the same time). She is passionate about inclusivity in technology and reaching users at a global scale. 

At the Foundation, Chelsea will contribute to both protocol design and implementation, and is looking forward to collaborating with researchers and engineers alike. She is excited to work with the Zcash Foundation to help advance the state of privacy in digital monetary transactions for everyone.
