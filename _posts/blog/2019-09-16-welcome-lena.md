Lena Wang is the Zcash Foundation's new operations associate! She will work with operations director Antonie Hodge to keep the Foundation running smoothly.

Lena attended Valencia College for two years before opting out to join a business apprenticeship bootcamp called Discover Praxis. She is a jill of all trades and has led an adventurous life since leaving school â€” Lena received a job offer from Tesla's Gigafactory, has public speaking experience, and traveled to economic and political conferences around the US to further her self-led education.
