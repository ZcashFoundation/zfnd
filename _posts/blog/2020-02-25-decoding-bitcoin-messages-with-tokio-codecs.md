In one of our [previous posts][network-stack], we wrote an overview of the
structure of the asynchronous network stack we designed for [Zebra], the Zcash
Foundation's forthcoming node implementation.  This post will zoom in to take a
close look at one small but interesting component: how we use Tokio's [codec]
functionality to implement the Bitcoin wire protocol used by Zcash.

Tokio's codecs provide a generic way to bridge between two fundamental
abstractions for async code: the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits, which
provide asynchronous byte-oriented I/O[^1], and the `Stream` and `Sink` traits,
which provide asynchronous streams and sinks of typed values.

It does this by providing two traits, [`Encoder`][tokio_encoder] and
[`Decoder`][tokio_decoder], and a [`Framed<T, U>`][tokio_framed] adapter which
wraps a byte-oriented `T: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite` and uses the `U: Encoder +
Decoder` to produce a `Stream + Sink` of the items produced by the codec.  For
implementors, this means that all that's required is to implement `Encoder` and
`Decoder` – specifying how items should turn into bytes and how bytes should be
parsed into items – and the `Framed` machinery handles the work of producing an
item-oriented `Stream + Sink`, allowing the rest of the code to focus on
handling individual items.

Because Zcash inherited its network protocol from Bitcoin, Zebra needs to work
with the (Zcash flavor of the) Bitcoin wire protocol.  Using Tokio's codecs,
this involves three steps: defining an item type, implementing the `Decoder`
trait, and implementing the `Encoder` trait.  In this post, we'll look at the
first two steps, since the third is more straightforward.

## Bitcoin's wire format and our `Message` type

The Bitcoin wire protocol encodes messages using a custom header structure
followed by an arbitrary-length payload.  The message structure is as follows:

|--------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------|
|      4 bytes  | magic value identifying the network the message is for |
| 12 bytes      | null-padded ascii identifier for message type          |
| 4 bytes       | little-endian encoding of payload length               |
| 4 bytes       | payload checksum (truncated double SHA-256)            |
| arbitrary     | message payload                                        |

Rather than using, e.g., numeric codes, the message type is identified using an
ascii string, such as `block\0\0\0\0\0\0\0`.  This ascii string is used in
`zcashd` in a long chain of `if` statements that combine parsing the message
payload with processing the payload contents.

Instead, we treat the entire header structure as an encoding detail and create
a `Message` enum with a variant for each message type.  Enums are an extremely
convenient and powerful tool, because they allow expressing [sum
types][sum_type], saying that a value can take on one of several different
variants and allowing the compiler to check that all possible variants are
handled.  And rather than containing byte payloads, each `Message` variant
contains a fully-parsed internal representation of the payload data.

This means that **all message parsing and validation is performed in one
place**, in the codec, so that the rest of the implementation is provided with
either an error or a parsed and validated internal representation of the
message's content.  If you're curious, you can see the full description of the
`Message` enum in the [internal documentation for the `zebra-network`
crate][message_docs]. [^2]

## The `Decoder` trait

The core functionality of the [`Decoder`][tokio_decoder] trait is provided by
the `decode` method:
```rust
fn decode(
    &mut self, 
    src: &mut BytesMut
) -> Result<Option<Self::Item>, Self::Error>;
```
It's worth unpacking the types in this method signature, because they reveal a
lot of information about how the decoder works.

First, since the receiver of the `decode` method is `&mut self`, we know that
the decoder is able to keep some decoding state and update it as it's asked to
decode messages.

Next, the `src` buffer is a `&mut BytesMut`.  The [`BytesMut` type][bytesmut]
is from the [`bytes` crate][bytes], which provides abstractions for zero-copy
handling of byte arrays.  The `Bytes` and `BytesMut` types are essentially
lightweight views into a reference-counted backing buffer, so that copying and
manipulating values doesn't require copying the underlying data.  Multiple
`Bytes` objects can have overlapping views of the same data, while the
`BytesMut` type guarantees exclusive access and therefore allows mutation.

Passing a `&mut BytesMut` reference to the source buffer means that the view of
the source buffer is shared between the codec and its caller (because of
`&mut`), so the codec can mark some portion of the source buffer as having been
consumed, and that that view is an exclusive view of the source buffer (because
of `BytesMut`), so the codec can take ownership of the data it consumes.

Finally, the return type is a `Result<Option<Self::Item>, Self::Error>`.  This
means that instead of just signaling that an error occurred (returning
`Err(Self::Error)`) or that an item was parsed (returning `Some(Self::Item)`),
a codec can also signal that no error occurred but that no item is ready yet
(returning `Ok(None)`).  In an asynchronous context, this allows "trial
decoding" as new data arrives, producing frames as soon as they are ready.

# Implementing `Decoder`

Traits are implemented by types, so to implement `Decoder` we need to provide a
type that will implement the trait.  For simpler protocols that can be
statelessly decoded, this could be a unit struct, but for the Bitcoin protocol
we need to maintain decoder state.  This can be split into two parts:
configuration like the network version, which we construct with a [builder],
and the decode state itself:
```rust
struct Codec {
    builder: Builder,
    state: DecodeState,
}

enum DecodeState {
    Head,
    Body {
        body_len: usize,
        command: [u8; 12],
        checksum: Sha256dChecksum,
    },
}
```
The [implementation of `decode`][decode_impl] starts by matching on the
`self.state`.  

If it's `DecodeState::Head`, we check whether the source buffer has at least
`HEADER_LEN` bytes.  If not, we know we're not ready to start decoding, so we
return `Ok(None)`.  Otherwise, we read the fields of the header, and set
`self.state` to `DecodeState::Body` with the data we parsed, or return `Err` if
there was a problem with the header.

If it's `DecodeState::Body`, we check whether the source buffer has at least
`body_len` bytes, or return `Ok(None)`.  Otherwise, we remove the body from the
source buffer, recompute the checksum, and use the `command` field to determine
what `Message` variant to parse and construct.

With an implementation of `Codec: Encoder + Decoder` in hand, we can use
Tokio's `Framed` adapter to transform any byte-oriented `AsyncRead +
AsyncWrite` instance into a `Stream + Sink` of `Message`s.  This can be seen in
action in the following [`tracing` output][tracing] from some Zebra stub code
talking to a local Zcashd instance:

```ascii
Feb 21 13:58:26.159 TRACE peer{addr=V4(127.0.0.1:8233)}: zebra_network::peer::connection: awaiting response to client request
Feb 21 13:58:26.159 TRACE peer{addr=V4(127.0.0.1:8233)}: zebra_network::protocol::external::codec: src buffer does not have an entire header, waiting self.state=DecodeState::Head

```

The first line is emitted from the connection state machine, which holds a
`Framed` stream produced by a `Codec`.  When it `await`s the next message from
the stream, it polls the stream's readiness, but there's no data in the source
buffer, so the codec returns `Ok(None)`.  Next, new data arrives in the source
buffer, and the codec is able to parse the message header, determining that the
message contains a block and is 11102 bytes long.  When it tries to parse the
body, however, there are only 4492 bytes of data in the source buffer, so it
again returns `Ok(None)`.  In the last line, there is finally enough data to
parse the message body.

As an aside, this output is extremely verbose, recording every step of the
decoding process, because it's captured at `trace` level.  Each event is
emitted in the context of a particular *span*, a logical execution context – in
this case, in the context of the peer connection with a particular address.
One extremely powerful feature of `tracing` we use in Zebra is the ability to
**dynamically configure the tracing level *for a particular span filter*.**  This
means that while the node is running, we can zoom all the way in to inspect
particular execution contexts, such as "the `peer` span with
`addr=V4{127.0.0.1:8233}`", "all IPv6 connections", etc, without drowning in
noise generated by the rest of the node's tasks.

The Bitcoin networking protocol is a mess to implement, but we were able to
save a great deal of time and effort by reusing Tokio components to isolate
parsing to one place, allowing the rest of our networking stack to deal only
with streams of messages.  The vibrant ecosystem of async Rust libraries has
made it much easier to make progress on building a solid, modern foundation for
Zcash, and we're excited about the quality and speed of protocol development
and interoperability it will unlock.  

Stay tuned for the next post in this series, where we'll talk more about how we
use algebraic data types to model Zcash structures!

[^1]: Unfortunately there is not yet consensus in the async Rust ecosystem about what exactly the `AsyncRead` and `AsyncWrite` traits should be, mainly due to disagreement about the best way to handle uninitialized buffers and vectored I/O.  More details can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/1744) and in these comments: [1](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/1744#issuecomment-558736715), [2](https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio/pull/1744#issuecomment-558970440).

[^2]: We render two copies of the documentation for our crates.  One is [`doc.zebra.zfnd.org`](https://doc.zebra.zfnd.org), containing documentation for the public interfaces of these crates; the other is [`doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org`](https://doc-internal.zebra.zfnd.org), containing documentation for all of the internal items.  Because we translate the Bitcoin network protocol into our own request/response protocol, we don't publicly expose the `Message` type from the `zebra-network` crate, so this link is to the internal documentation.
