As we often remind you, the Zcash Foundation's mission is to create and support privacy infrastructure for the public good. What does that mean in practice — can a cryptocurrency like Zcash be called "infrastructure"?

Well, yes. A cryptocurrency is a living network, sustained by miners with their server racks, users with their nodes, developers who write node clients, and everyone's continual reinvestment in the underlying protocol. The existence of the network is _created_ by the confluence of many individual choices to "plug in" and join the party. This is why cryptocurrencies are discussed in terms of ecosystems — [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) is but one (important) constituent of bitcoin the phenomenon; bitcoin the movement.

When the Zcash Foundation officially became a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, [board member Peter Van Valkenburgh wrote](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zcash-foundation-officially-nonprofit/) that "online public infrastructure and the science that makes it safe and private are just as much public goods as roads, reservoirs, and clean air or water."

In the physical world, we use roads, railways, and ships to move things around. In the virtual world, the globally connected "space" of the internet, we rely instead on protocols. A digital [protocol](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/protocol) is a set of standards for consistently handling information, usually for a particular purpose, so that it can be passed back and forth between strangers and yet consistently understood each time. For example, the "http" snippet at the beginning of a URL stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which computers use to exchange files like the webpages that you and I interact with via browser.

Even the simplest Morse code message is a protocol. If nobody else knows that •••///••• means SOS, why bother broadcasting it? The value of a protocol comes from its shared use, leading to the oft-touted [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect#Benefits). A decentralized network lives and dies by its protocol, since that is how people are able to participate — by following the rules of the protocol in order to join the network. The more people use the protocol, the more people you can reach by using the protocol, and thus the more attractive it becomes as a means of communication.

The internet consists of protocols layered on top of protocols. In 2016, in his role as Coin Center director of research, Peter [published a paper called "Open Matters."](https://coincenter.org/entry/open-matters) In it he explained why openness — everyone and anyone being able to join — is important:

> The underlying protocols that power the Internet — TCP/IP (the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol) — are open technical specifications. Think of them like human languages; anyone is free to learn them, and if you learn a language well you can write anything in that language and share it: books, magazines, movie scripts, political speeches, and more. Importantly, you never need to seek permission from the _Institut Français_ or the _Agenzia Italiana_ to build these higher level creations on top of the lower level languages. Indeed, no one can stop you from learning and using a language.
