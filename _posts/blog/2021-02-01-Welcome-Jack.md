The Zcash Foundation is very excited to welcome Jack Gavigan as its new Executive Director. 

With over ten years of experience in finance, and four years at the Electric Coin Company, Jack's deep knowledge of Zcash, and his alignment with the Foundation's values makes him the ideal person to guide the Zcash Foundation into its preschool years. 

The Foundation has spent its first three years establishing itself as a key member of the  Zcash ecosystem, and now Jack will lead the organization as it continues its mission building and supporting the deployment of decentralized, censorship-resistant, financial privacy infrastructure.

Jack is eager to build on the Foundation's [strategy and roadmap of growing user adoption](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/the-zcash-foundation-would-like-to-grow-user-adoption/). He looks forward to working with the Foundation's talented engineering team with a view to launching the Zebra Zcash node implementation later this year, to provide a built-from-scratch alternative to zcashd. 

Jack's arrival at the Zcash Foundation marks the conclusion of a months-long executive search process carried out by the board and staff. We thank Antonie Hodge for serving as interim executive director during this time.

Some background on Jack: Jack has a background in financial technology. He spent over a decade working on trading systems at major financial institutions such as Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, and Morgan Stanley (where he also spent a year as a trader). He became an advisor to the Electric Coin Company in early 2016, and joined the company as COO shortly before the launch of Zcash in October 2016. He relinquished the role of COO in 2018, and his recent focus has been on regulatory relations.
