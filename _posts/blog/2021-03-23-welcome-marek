The Zcash Foundation is delighted to welcome Marek as a Cryptography Engineer. 

Marek is an advocate of information privacy, FOSS and open-source hardware. He is currently pursuing a Masters in Computer Science at the Czech Technical University, where he also was a mentor in cryptography classes. His research includes work on algebraic cryptanalysis. Marek will work part-time at the Foundation until his much-anticipated graduation in June, but even during his interviewing, he found a bug in Zebraâ€™s implementation of the Zcash spec that we were able to fix. 

During his undergraduate studies, he was a software engineer at the research and incubation center at TU Dublin. He has been closely watching the development of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, and sees great potential in this technology while recognising that it is still, in many ways, immature. Marek is a passionate programmer with a particular interest in cryptography and is thrilled to help with the development of Zcash.
