The Zcash Foundation is thrilled to welcome Conrado as a Cryptography Engineer. 
 
Conrado is a cryptography engineer who carried out research into the efficient software implementation of cryptographic algorithms such as elliptic curves, pairings, and authenticated encryption during his Masters and PhD studies at the University of Campinas.
 
Since then, he has been working for eight years in industry, developing software for cryptographic devices such as tokens and hardware security modules (HSMs), and has been involved in the development of a new HSM from the start. He has also participated in projects involving secure communications, writing and tailoring cryptographic libraries.
