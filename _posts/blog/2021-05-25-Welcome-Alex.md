The Zcash Foundation is very excited to welcome Alex Bornstein as our Chief Operating Officer.
 
Alex has enjoyed a colorful 25 year career in the governmental and non-profit sectors, beginning with a domestic operations and supply chain focus and then progressing to international non-profit leadership. Alex has managed operations for a large fire district in Oregon, created a supply chain division for an international humanitarian aid organization active in over sixty countries, led operations for an innovative foodbank with a state-wide footprint, and grown a youth focused non-profit into an impactful and well-regarded international organization.
 
Alex is looking forward to utilizing his deep knowledge of non-profit operations to support the Foundation’s mission of building and supporting privacy infrastructure for the public good while upholding and advancing the Foundation’s three values: transparency, inclusivity, and humility. He is eager and motivated to support the incredible Zcash team and community in pursuit of our ambitious and impactful goals.
