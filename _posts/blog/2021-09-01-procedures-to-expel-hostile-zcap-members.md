As the Zcap board is expanding, some Zcash community members [discovered](https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/ideas-for-how-to-expel-hostile-unconstructive-zcap-members/39872/5) currently sitting member repeatedly sucker-punched the Zcash project publicly.
As such, it became apparent that there was no formal procedure to remove this individual from the Zcap board.

## Scenarios

We identify **2 scenarios** that could lead to the removal of a Zcap member.

### Process for Expelling Persistently Hostile/Unconstructive ZCAP Members

1. Community Petition
    - Create a post in the Zcash Community Forum (ZCF) to recommend a ZCAP member be expelled from ZCAP for hostile or unconstructive behavior.
    - Provide support (e.g. tweets, forum posts, etc.) that demonstrates the member has persistently acted in a hostile or unconstructive manner.
    - Encourage feedback from community members

2. Review Process
    - The petition will be reviewed by the ZF Executive Director (ED) or their delegate to determine whether to reject or accept the petition based on the allegations made, support provided, and community input. Note: The ED or their delegate are not deciding whether the member should or should not be expelled, but whether or not the allegations and support warrant the ZCAP being polled.
    - Reject – The ED or their delegate will briefly explain their reasoning for rejecting the petition in the relevant ZCF thread.
    - Accept – Whether or not to remove the member will be an item in the next scheduled ZCAP poll.

3. Voting Process
    - Three choices: (1) Approve, (2) Reject, (3) Abstain
    - If “Approve” receives more than half of all votes, the member is removed from ZCAP

### Suspension from ZCF = Immediate Expulsion from ZCAP

If a ZCAP member is suspended from the ZCF for a violation of the Zcash Community Code of Conduct (CoC), that member shall be immediately expelled from the ZCAP.
