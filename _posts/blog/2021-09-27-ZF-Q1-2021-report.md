Throughout the last year, ZF has experienced significant changes to the team: from new leadership to team reorganization and expansion. This transition period presented both challenges and opportunities, but ZF worked arduously to address the challenges, while also capitalizing on the opportunities. 
 
While ZF’s engineering team experienced robust growth, one of the challenges ZF experienced was a shortage of communications staff, which resulted in some delays in reporting. ZF transformed this challenge into an opportunity to improve its communication - by creating a new role and assigning reporting, among other activities, to the [new Head of Communications](/blog/welcome-winfred/). ZF would like to thank its community members for their patience as we worked to fill this role. 

[Here’s an update on ZF’s progress during the first quarter of the year](/about/reports/ZF_Q1_2021_REPORT.pdf). A second quarter update will follow soon.
