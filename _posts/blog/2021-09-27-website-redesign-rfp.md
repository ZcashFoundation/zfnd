We're planning to revamp the Zcash Foundation website, to better support our goal of improving the way to communicate with the Zcash community and the world at large. 

We are issuing an open request for proposals (RFP), and invite interested parties to submit proposals by 18th October 2021. 

The RFP can be downloaded **[here](/about/Zfnd_website_RFP_20210927.pdf)**.
