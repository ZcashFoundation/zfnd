At the Zcash Foundation, we believe that transparency in our reporting breeds trust amongst our community members and stakeholders who interact with us at all levels. We also understand that our community’s decisions are based on assessments of past performance, which influence expectations of future performance.

Last week, we released our quarterly report for the first quarter of 2021. Today, we're releasing our quarterly report for the second quarter of 2021. As with the report for the first quarter, which we released last week, this report describes our financial inflow and outflows, with a detailed breakdown of our expenses. It also provides an overview of Zcash Foundation engineering team’s activities, introduces three new additions to the team, and describes other activities the Foundation undertook during this period.
