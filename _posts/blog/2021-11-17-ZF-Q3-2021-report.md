The Zcash Foundation is committed to being transparent with the Zcash community and our other stakeholders. Today, we are releasing our quarterly report for the third quarter of 2021. As with our previous quarterly reports, this report describes our financial inflow and outflows, with a detailed breakdown of our expenses, and we have included a snapshot of the Foundation's financial position, in terms of liquid assets and liabilities that must be met using those assets.

This report also provides our regular overview of the Zcash Foundation engineering team's activities, introduces two new members of the Zcash Foundation team, and give an overview of some of the other activities the Foundation undertook during this period.
