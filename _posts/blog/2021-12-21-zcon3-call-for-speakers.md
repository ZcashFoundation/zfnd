After the success of Zcon2 Lite, our first fully-virtual conference, we are happy to announce that Zcon3 will be held in late June 2022 and will be virtual, with the possibility of an in-person component. We recognize that there is great benefit to connecting with others in person and we hope to be able to bring everyone together in Toronto, Canada. However, safety is our top priority and we will provide an update in spring 2022 regarding our ability to host attendees in person. 

Zcon is not possible without diverse speakers from the privacy and Zcash communities. **If you are interested in speaking/presenting/leading a workshop at Zcon3, virtually, in-person, or either, [please fill out this RFP form](https://forms.gle/QsYRTW1aBnYMTbuC9). The deadline to submit is February 14, 2022.** 

Last yearâ€™s Zcon presentations can be viewed on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40dyJ0UYTLLa68H9ibpiSZqeevqKizg4). For Zcon3, we are looking for innovative subject-matter, presentations and panel discussions that will be relevant and of interest to the privacy and Zcash communities.
