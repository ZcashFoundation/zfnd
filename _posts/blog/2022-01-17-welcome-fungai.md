The Zcash Foundation is pleased to welcome Fungai Matambanadzo as its Engineering Project Manager, while our current Enginering Manager is away on sabbatical.
 
Fungai has over 10 yearsâ€™ experience working with different-sized companies in different domains within the tech industry - his most recent area of focus being scrum/project management. Fungai was drawn to the Engineering Project Manager position at the Zcash Foundation due to his enthusiasm and passion for blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency industry as a whole, which he believes will be adopted by mainstream society in the near and long term. Fungai is excited to be a part of Zcash Foundation and is looking forward to working closely with the engineering team on Zebra, and the Foundation's other upcoming engineering projects.

Welcome, Fungai!
