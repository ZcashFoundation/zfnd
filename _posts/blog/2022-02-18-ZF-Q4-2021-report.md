The Zcash Foundation is committed to being transparent with the Zcash community and our other stakeholders. Today, we are releasing our quarterly report for the fourth quarter of 2021. As with our previous quarterly reports, this report describes our financial inflow and outflows, with a detailed breakdown of our expenses, and a snapshot of the Foundation's financial position, in terms of liquid assets and liabilities that must be met using those assets.

This report also provides our regular overview of the Zcash Foundation engineering team's activities, and gives an overview of some of the other activities the Foundation undertook during this period.
