2. Funding report, plans for how to handle it:

- Board agreed to a broad strategy of folding funds primarily in Zcash (we’re less relevant if Zcash value crashes)
  Some in dollars for bare minimum of near/medium term expenses.
- Operational: possibly a multi-sig scheme where 5 of directors should hold key shards, policy to be determined. 3 of 5 to sign? 
- We begin with donation pledges of portions of the Founder's Reward, the largest of which comes from Least Authority
- Board agreed to prefer a 1-time permanent transfer of rights rather than month-to-month

3. Priorities, ideas.

- Community development, diversity
- Communication platforms to hear stakeholders and actively encourage their participation. e.g. Miners, mining pools
- Development funds, bug bounties, fellowships

4. Future of governance process.

- Start with no governance framework, but develop one. Goal is to eventually over to the “community”, via the “governance process”, in 9 months.
- By polling current users. We should also represent people who are not part of the community yet.
