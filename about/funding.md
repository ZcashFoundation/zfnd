title: How the Zcash Foundation Is Funded
excerpt: "The Zcash Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit funded by generous donors."
---

As of 2021, the Zcash Foundation's primary source of income is the [Zcash Dev Fund](https://z.cash/zcash-development-and-governance/). The Zcash Community created the Dev Fund in late 2020 as a means of funding ongoing development of the Zcash protocol by the Electric Coin Company, the Zcash Foundation, and the Zcash Open Major Grants program. 

Annually, the Zcash Foundation receives approximately 65,745 ZEC from the Dev Fund, plus 105,192 ZEC as a restricted donation which may only be disbursed as major grants. 

We release quarterly reports that describe our income and expenditure, with a detailed breakdown of our expenses, and a snapshot of the Foundationâ€™s financial position, in terms of liquid assets and liabilities that must be met using those assets. The most recent quarterly report (for Q3 2021) can be found [here](https://www.zfnd.org/about/reports/ZF_Q3_2021_REPORT.pdf).

Prior to the Dev Fund, the Zcash Foundation received its funds from individual donors, the vast majority of whom were recipients of the Zcash [Founders' Reward](https://electriccoin.co/blog/funding/).

As stated by Electric Coin Company CEO Zooko Wilcox [in 2016](https://electriccoin.co/blog/continued-funding-and-transparency/), at that point the Zcash Foundation was slated to receive 260,226.130148 ZEC, also expressed as approximately 1.44% of the total monetary base.

In August, 2019, [ECC announced](https://electriccoin.co/blog/electric-coin-company-statement-on-sustainability/) that recipients of the Founders' Reward had agreed to a dilution. The total amount pledged to be donated to the Zcash Foundation was reduced to 229,462.889689 ZEC, also expressed as roughly 1.09% of the total monetary base.

## Previous Donors

- Least Authority Enterprises: 247,122.601044 ZEC. After dilution, the total amount pledged to be donated will be 217,856.550137 ZEC. Here is [Least Authority's pledge agreement](/about/contracts/2018_LAE_ZF_pledge.pdf) and the [amendment that reflects the dilution](/about/contracts/2019_LAE_ZF_pledge_amendment.pdf).
- Alan Fairless, Andrew Miller, Ariel Gabizon, and Jack Gavigan are the other donors that are recipients of the Founders' Reward for a total of 11,606.33955 ZEC (post-dilution).
- In 2018, the Blockchain Institute donated 125,000 USD as matching funds for the grant program.

We are grateful for the generous contributions of our donors. Without them, our work would not be possible.
