excerpt: "The Zcash Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit funded by generous donors."
---

The Zcash Foundation receives its funds from individual donors, the vast majority of whom are recipients of the [Founders' Reward](https://electriccoin.co/blog/funding/).

As stated by Electric Coin Company CEO Zooko Wilcox [in 2016](https://electriccoin.co/blog/continued-funding-and-transparency/), at that point the Zcash Foundation was slated to receive 260,226.130148 ZEC, also expressed as approximately 1.44% of the total monetary base.

In August, 2019, [ECC announced](https://electriccoin.co/blog/electric-coin-company-statement-on-sustainability/) that recipients of the Founders' Reward had agreed to a dilution. The total amount pledged to be donated to the Zcash Foundation was reduced to 229,462.889689 ZEC, also expressed as roughly 1.09% of the total monetary base.

## Current Donors

- Least Authority Enterprises: 247,122.601044 ZEC. After dilution, the total amount pledged to be donated will be 217,856.550137 ZEC. Here is [Least Authority's pledge agreement](/about/contracts/2018_LAE_ZF_pledge.pdf) and the [amendment that reflects the dilution](/about/contracts/2019_LAE_ZF_pledge_amendment.pdf).
- Alan Fairless, Andrew Miller, Ariel Gabizon, and Jack Gavigan are the other donors that are recipients of the Founders' Reward for a total of 11,606.33955 ZEC (post-dilution).
- In 2018, the Blockchain Institute donated 125,000 USD as matching funds for the grant program.

We are grateful for the generous contributions of our donors. Without them, our work would not be possible.
