1. In publications supported by this grant (including papers, web pages and software), please acknowledge at an appropriate place that the work was "supported by a Zcash Open Major Grant". (This can be omitted where impractical, e.g., when contributing a small software patch to an external project.)

1. We request that you keep the community informed of your ongoing progress by using your grant thread on the Zcash Forums and the usual Zcash community channels. Please be attentive to community feedback by responding to comments on the thread in a timely fashion.

1. For every milestone listed on your grant page (on https://grants.zfnd.org/), including once your grant is complete, provide a publicly accessible update on the Zcash Forums.

   1. A photocopy of your state-issued identification (passport, driver's license, etc.)
   1. A filled-out form W-9 (if US taxpayer) or W-8BEN (if nonresident alien individual), or a W-8BEN-E (if foreign corporation)

(ii)  neither you or any affiliated person or entity is a person that is listed in the annex to, or is otherwise subject to the provisions of, the Executive Order or a person that is named as a “specially designated national and blocked person” on the most current list published by the US Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) at its official website or any replacement website or other replacement official publication of such list; (iii) neither you or any affiliated person or entity is subject to blocking provisions or otherwise a target of sanctions imposed under any sanctions program administered by OFAC; and (iv) neither you or any affiliate person or entity deals in, or otherwise engages in any transaction relating to any property or interests in property blocked pursuant to the Executive Order.

1. You may not assign, or otherwise transfer, your rights or delegate any of your obligations under this grant without prior written approval from the Zcash Foundation.

1. Tax Implications: Please be aware that in some countries, taxes will be due on the grant funds you receive. Specifically: With certain limited exceptions, in the following January the Zcash Foundation will report the value of the grant as taxable income on either US tax form 1099-MISC (for US taxpayers) or 1042-S (for foreign persons). These forms will report the value of the award at the date it was distributed. You may need to include this income when filing your taxes, and it may affect your total tax due and estimated tax payments. Here are more details on filing the 1099-MISC in the US, and its tax implications.
