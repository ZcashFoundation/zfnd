<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>

The Zcash Foundation is a public charity that builds and supports privacy infrastructure for the public good. We work on strengthening financial privacy with technology, focused on the Zcash protocol and blockchain.

Our goal at ZF is to create tools that help sustain open networks, enabling anyone and everyone to protect their own privacy on their own terms. The essence of privacy itself is being able to choose what is or isnâ€™t shared with others. Privacy comprises both autonomy and consent; it is essential to human dignity and the healthy continuation of civil society.

## Programs
