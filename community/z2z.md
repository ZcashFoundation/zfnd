## About the Registry

The z2z Registry is a list of people who want to send and receive shielded memos. For fun! For the pure joy of playful private communication. It's not a replacement for [Pay With Zcash](https://paywithz.cash/), nor is the registry meant for donation addresses. Rather, this page is a convenient place for Zcash users to find each other and start chatting.

"z2z" is the Zcash community's term for transactions between shielded addresses. A z2z transaction can be 0 ZEC, in which case the user only pays the default mining fee of 0.0001 ZEC. Such transactions are often used to exchange shielded memos â€” text notes that can be included in z2z transactions. (This feature is called "encrypted memos" in the [Zcash "How It Works" FAQ](https://z.cash/technology/), but the term "shielded memos" is more commonly used.)

[ZecWallet](https://docs.zecwallet.co/) is the best tool for shielded memos. There's a handy [video tutorial](https://docs.zecwallet.co/video-tutorials/#using-memos) that demonstrates how to use it.

## Joining Instructions

Send a shielded memo to this Zcash address:

> zs1xaecful95zzy37xs0jztesg7axtt7xxv402rsjgphrj68vj9aka9hfgm4dkqnmyz45d75k65w6z

Include the z-address that you want to be published. Optional: Two or three topics that interest you.

If you wish to associate a name or handle with your z-address on the Registry, please post the address publicly, and then send a link to the public post in the shielded memo.

Participate at your own risk. Publishing a z-address means that anyone can contact you anonymously, at any time, and you can't do anything to stop them. In addition, [please remember](https://z.cash/support/security/privacy-security-recommendations/): "The improvements made in Zcash are a big step towards decentralized, financial privacy but there are some important considerations for users who want to maintain optimal transaction privacy, no matter which wallet software is being used."
