title: z2z Registry
excerpt: "Join the z2z Registry to send and receive Zcash shielded memos!"
---

"z2z" is the Zcash community's term for transactions between shielded addresses. A z2z transaction can be as low as 0.0001 ZEC (the miner fee), and such small transactions are often used to exchange shielded memos. (This feature of ZEC is called "encrypted memos" in the ["How It Works" FAQ](https://z.cash/technology/), but typically people use the term "shielded memos.")

If you're not sure how to send a z2z note using shielded memos, [ZecWallet](https://docs.zecwallet.co/) is currently the best tool, and there's a handy [video tutorial](https://docs.zecwallet.co/video-tutorials/#using-memos) as well.

The z2z registry is not a replacement for [Pay With Zcash](https://paywithz.cash/), nor is it meant for soliciting donations. Rather, it's a list of other people who want to send and receive shielded memos. For fun! For the pure joy of playful private communication.

However, participate at your own risk: Publishing a z-address means that anyone can contact you, at any time, and you can't do anything about it. Your only recourse is to abandon the address. In addition, [please remember](https://z.cash/support/security/privacy-security-recommendations/): "The improvements made in Zcash are a big step towards decentralized, financial privacy but there are some important considerations for users who want to maintain optimal transaction privacy, no matter which wallet software is being used."
