excerpt: ""
---

The Zcash Community Advisory Panel (ZCAP) is a panel of community members who are eligible to take part in advisory polls conducted by the Zcash Foundation. 

The ZCAP was [originally formed in 2018](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zcon0-and-community-governance/) as a community governance panel. It was [expanded in 2019, 2020](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/expanding-cap/), and most recently in [June 2021](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/preparing-for-zf-board-elections/). It has provided input on the [appointment of Zcash Foundation board members](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/governance-voting/), was instrumental in the [governance process that resulted in ZIP 1014](https://www.zfnd.org/blog/zip-1014-poll-results/) (which established the Dev Fund), and [elects the Zcash Open Major Grants committee members](https://vote.heliosvoting.org/helios/elections/fd30d13c-e010-11ea-88f3-4a6a23563c24/view). 

You can [review the panel's history on GitHub](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zfnd/commits/master/governance/community-advisory-panel.md).
