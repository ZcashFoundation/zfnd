The Zcash Foundation runs our Grants Program twice a year, in the second and fourth quarters of the year. We are currently wrapping up the Q2 edition and will beginning accepting applications for Q4 shortly.

Most of the Grants Program is organized on GitHub. You can peruse the CFP, applications, and feedback at the links below.
