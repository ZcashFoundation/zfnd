What can benefit the Zcash community to fully adopt Z-addresses? 

Coming up with metrics 

Shielded transaction: Z address to Z address. The only thing that is exposed is the transaction fee.

Run Zcash on TOR to be safe from leaking IP information.

Point 1: 
User interface to enhance the perception of shielded address

Point 2:
Institutions prefer T-addresses due to technical reasons, it's cheap computationally. Without institutions supporting Z-addresses it'll be too hard to get it off the ground. 

Point 3:
Business analytics (understanding adoption) and metrics on how the network operates and what the community actually wants/needs.

Ideas for metrics:

IP address linkability
Fee linkability
Linkability via peer preference through transactions entering the mempool

Ideas for improving privacy:

Privacy score: giving users a privacy score in their wallet (gamifying UX - give people a bad score if they are doing something wrong)
