### Maintaining T vs Z addresses in the protocol

Beneficial to Zcash to be based off of BTC source code

Questions around protocol changes:

- Making shielding transaction mandatory in the next upgrade? 
- How do we transition into an entirely shielded addresses protocol? 
- How do we get rid of transparent addresses holding funds?

### Making shielded transactions mandatory

Removing T-addresses

**Pros** 

1 address type
UX/Privacy mental model
Remove technical debt 
Fungbility of coins 

**Cons**

Proclude use cases
Proclude better performance
Bitcoin infrastructure compatibility
If Z-addresses banned, no T-addresses to fall back to

### Questions

1. How to choose when/if to transition?
2. Is Sapling performance/UX acceptable?
3. How to incentivize 3rd party adoption?
4. What about audits for exchanges/institutions?
5. What about block rewards ? 
6. Is this for Sapling or later?
7. When would it be too late?

Audience: 
Chain of provenance: Working with institutions, View keys selective disclosure isn't enough for institutional adoption.

Audience: 
Build a simple and clean user interface that would allow people to use Z addresses in a simpler way helping drive the adoption of Z addresses as the main address type of Zcash hence improving privacy on the blockchain. 

Some exchanges are already working on supporting Sapling.
