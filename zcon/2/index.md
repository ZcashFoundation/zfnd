Yes! [Download Discord](https://discord.com/download) or log into your existing account, join the [Zcon2 Lite Discord Server](https://discord.gg/sMNcpwU39q). Each session has a dedicated channel for session-relation questions and discussion. Speakers will address some of the questions posted in the session specific channel when they are live.

- **&#35;lobby**: This is where you’ll enter the conference and is a great place to ask general conference questions like how the conference works.

- **&#35;jobs**: For those looking for work or have employment opportunities.

- **&#35;technical-off-the-stage**: To discuss topics that are not covered in the conference sessions.

- **&#35;lightning-talks**: Post a short video of a project or ideas you want to share.

- **&#35;non-technical-banter**: Zebras just want to have fun!

Each session has a channel dedicated to the session topic labeled the session title. Ask presenters questions while they are live and converse with other attendees about the session topic (both sync and async). 

**What if I miss one of the sessions? Will I have access to the recordings?**<BR>
Yes! All session videos will remain on the Foundation's YouTube channel so you can watch them at your own convenience.
