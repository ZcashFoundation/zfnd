*14:40-15:25 UTC on Tuesday 8th June 2021* - [*Add this session to your Google Calendar*](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MHAxdGUycDFraThmcmNkamF0cHZhdThpb3QgY18yODc5dHIyNHVjZDV2cGxuaXY2aHF1Zzlpc0Bn&tmsrc=c_2879tr24ucd5vplniv6hqug9is%40group.calendar.google.com)

The idea of allowing users to issue digital assets on the Zcash blockchain (similar in nature to ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum) [pre-dates the launch of Zcash](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/830). Different names have been used to refer to this concept, including user-defined assets, user-issued tokens, and Zcash shielded assets. In this panel we will discuss the potential use cases, advantages and pitfalls or adding this functionality to the Zcash blockchain.

In addition to "Inventor of the ICO", J.R. has also been credited as "Inventor of the Stablecoin", as his landmark 2012 whitepaper introducing the ICO concept also described how to algorithmically stabilize a token to peg to an external asset, like the dollar. Numerous projects have since put his ideas into practice.

Building an open-source developer community is like posting a job offer for zero-thousand dollars. Despite this challenge, the ECC wallet team has made relentless efforts to foster a stronger community around Zcash. As a result, we have received more contributions in the last few months than in the last few years, combined! This session covers the lessons learned along the way. First, we will contrast what has failed against what has worked. Then, we will conclude by outlining our ideas around incentive plans and developer appreciation, going forward.

<h3 id="hsms">HSMs & Hardware Wallets</h3>

*18:45-19:30 UTC on Tuesday 8th June 2021* - [*Add this session to your Google Calendar*](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MGw4c24yMWVyY2M4ZGFmcWNrMzFidW9jZ3QgY18yODc5dHIyNHVjZDV2cGxuaXY2aHF1Zzlpc0Bn&tmsrc=c_2879tr24ucd5vplniv6hqug9is%40group.calendar.google.com)

The crypto sector has seen widespread adoption of hardware-based security solutions for protection of private keys. Exchanges and custodians typically use hardware security modules designed for enterprise use, while hardware wallets from companies like Ledger and Trezor are popular for personal use. While transparent Zcash addresses are compatible with solutions that support Bitcoin, the lack of support for shielded addresses is an obstacle to broader adoption of shielded Zcash. In this panel, we have assembled a group of individuals with experience and expertise in building and using hardware-based security solutions, to discuss how we can improve the level of hardware-bsed support for shielded Zcash. 

* Juan Leni leads the Zondax team. They are behind many of the hardware wallet apps that you use everyday. Zondax works with many of top projects in areas such as cryptography, remote signers, protocol development and integration.

<h3 id="halo2">The Orchard Shielded Pool, feat. Halo2</h3>

*19:40-20:40 UTC on Tuesday 8th June 2021* - [*Add this session to your Google Calendar*](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NzJxcnNpcjd0NjJiOWgxamNudGM3bmtvOGQgY18yODc5dHIyNHVjZDV2cGxuaXY2aHF1Zzlpc0Bn&tmsrc=c_2879tr24ucd5vplniv6hqug9is%40group.calendar.google.com)

NU5 brings the third shielded pool, Orchard, to the Zcash protocol. Orchard is similar in a lot of ways to Sapling, but for some very important differences: the new Halo 2 recursive zk-SNARK proof system, based on new cyclic curves Pallas and Vesta; Actions instead of Spends or Outputs; and more. This session will lay out what Orchard brings to Zcash, how it differs from Sapling, and how Halo 2 removes the trusted setup for parameters and sets up Zcash for using recursive proofs in future upgrades.

* Sean Bowe  ([@ebfull](https://twitter.com/ebfull)) is a cryptographic engineer and researcher who has implemented, designed and discovered state-of-the-art cryptographic primitives and techniques, particularly focused on SNARKs and recursive proofs.

<h3 id="nup">Reworking the NUP</h3>

*20:50-21:20 UTC on Tuesday 8th June 2021* - [*Add this session to your Google Calendar*](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MmNvbHY2bm1nOXBlbDNhdDBqdDZjYTIwbTIgY18yODc5dHIyNHVjZDV2cGxuaXY2aHF1Zzlpc0Bn&tmsrc=c_2879tr24ucd5vplniv6hqug9is%40group.calendar.google.com)

The Network Upgrade Pipeline (NUP) was created to introduce synchronization points for Zcash protocol developers and to ensure that future network upgrades continued to meet our historic standards for safety and quality. We've had several successful network upgrades and learned a lot about the NUP and ways it could be improved especially when coordinating across additional node and protocol development teams. This session will review the rationale for the NUP and provide an overview of how it's evolved over the years.  We'll then explore ways we can further improve the NUP and make it work for multiple development teams while preserving the same standards and controls that have produced several successful network upgrades in the past.

In this talk, we will introduce FROST and the motivations for its design. We will review the security model under which FROST is secure, and how this security model compares to practical deployments of threshold signatures. We will discuss how FROST is compatible with existing Schnorr-based schemes, as well as next steps for FROST to be deployed in Zcash.

The field of cryptography is undergoing a rapid evolution, where the time from publishing a paper to having an implementation has gone down to weeks, or even days. Even more, those implementations are being used in widely deployed systems, sometimes holding billions of dollars in value. More than ever, it is critical for both researchers and developers to work together to ensure the security of these systems. We will try to outline some of the challenges in evaluating the security of the schemes and protocols along their lifetime from theory to deployment, and explore ways that the community can close this gap.

<h3 id="auditing">Auditing Cryptography</h3>

*16:45-17:30 UTC on Wednesday 9th June 2021* - [*Add this session to your Google Calendar*](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=NjhlZWgwN2t2ZDM2bmgycTBucnNnbjVrZWkgY18yODc5dHIyNHVjZDV2cGxuaXY2aHF1Zzlpc0Bn&tmsrc=c_2879tr24ucd5vplniv6hqug9is%40group.calendar.google.com)

Within cryptocurrency and blockchain solutions, the concepts of decentralization, security, scalability and privacy are all enabled by cryptography. If we are to believe that these technical solutions are reliable, we are relying on the cryptography they utilize. Audits of both the types and implementations of cryptography by industry professionals are critical to advancing these solutions. We'll discuss what it means to audit cryptography, how best to approach it and what we see as the future of cryptography audits.

<h3 id="interoperability">Interoperability Between Chains</h3>

*17:40-18:25 UTC on Wednesday 9th June 2021* - [*Add this session to your Google Calendar*](https://calendar.google.com/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=M2thcnNvcWk3MWQybmNpb2podjZjNmVuMzcgY18yODc5dHIyNHVjZDV2cGxuaXY2aHF1Zzlpc0Bn&tmsrc=c_2879tr24ucd5vplniv6hqug9is%40group.calendar.google.com)

With the rise of DeFi there has been a growing need for "transporting" digital assets between chains to take advantage of yield-earning opportunities. This has led to the invention and implementation of "interoperability protocols" that enable digital asset holders to move their assets from one chain to another. These protocols often differentiate themselves based on their trust/security models and cost efficiency. This panel will host a discussion with some of the leading developers of interoperability protocols to tease apart their differences, see what they have in common, explore the possibilities of User Defined Assets for Zcash, and discover what (if anything) Zcash needs or can offer to bring its world-class privacy technology to other chains.
