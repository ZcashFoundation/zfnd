Zcon is an annual conference focused on privacy-preserving technologies.

Due to world events, the Foundation has decided to cancel Zcon2 for 2020. At this time we are not considering an online equivalent. Please stay tuned in the fall for details of a future Zcon in June 2021! Thank you for your understanding.
